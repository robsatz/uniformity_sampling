# Uniformity Sampling
Contains experiment code of my Bachelor's Thesis titled "Predicting Uniformity: Active Sampling in the Uniformity Illusion" (2022). 

The Uniformity Illusion is a novel visual illusion described in Otten et al. (2017). When gaze is fixated on the center of a visual scene, peripheral stimuli tend to perceptually approximate central stimuli over time. Examples can be found  on http://www.uniformillusion.com/.

I investigated whether the visual illusion could be amplified by covertly manipulating the peripheral stimulus during saccades between center and periphery. Please reach out to me via email r.satzger@student.vu.nl if you would like to get access to the paper.
